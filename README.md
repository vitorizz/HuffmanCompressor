# HuffmanCompressor

Welcome to HuffmanCompressor - a Java implementation of the classic Huffman coding algorithm for efficient data compression.

## Overview

Huffman coding is a widely used method of lossless data compression. This project provides a complete implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in Java. It includes a custom-built Huffman Tree, a priority queue for efficient node management, and a two-way mapping system for fast encoding and decoding.

## Features

- **Huffman Tree Construction**: Build Huffman Trees based on character frequencies in the input data.
- **Custom Priority Queue**: Efficiently manage tree nodes during Huffman Tree construction.
- **Data Compression**: Encode input data into compressed binary formats using Huffman coding.
- **Data Decompression**: Decode Huffman-coded data back to its original form.
- **Two-Way Mapping**: Fast lookup for encoding and decoding processes.
- **Organize and Sort Utilities**: Pre-process input data for optimal Huffman coding.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/vitorizz/HuffmanCompressor.git

2. Compile the Java files in your preferred Java development environment.

3. Run `HCDriver.java` to start the compression/decompression process.
